These records are also utilized by SSA Claims Representatives to determine an individual's eligibility to receive disability/retirement (Title II) or supplemental security income (Title XVI) benefits.  Utilization of these records would assist field agents with verifying a targets income and employer.  In addition, these records can assist with identifying any unreported income received by a target in support of workman's compensation and money laundering investigations.

Consular Consolidated Database (CCD),"Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) is one of the largest Oracle based data warehouses in the world that holds current and archived data from the Consular Affairs (CA) domestic and post databases around the world. As of December 2009, it contains over 100 million visa cases and 75 million photographs, utilizing billions of rows of data, and has a current growth rate of approximately 35 thousand visa cases every day. It was created to provide CA a near real-time aggregate of the consular transaction activity collected domestically and at post databases around the world. The CCD is the IT  implementation that provides for a set of centralized visa and American citizen services supporting consular posts and back office functions.  Utilization of these records would assist field agents with obtaining foreign nationals visa applications and photographs for historical analysis.  In addition, field agents would have access to U.S. Citizens (USC) passport applications and photographs.   ",None available,Resources,Military/Government Systems
